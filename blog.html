    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>
      Technology has always been part of humanity. It has provided us with
      different hacks we employ in our daily ways of life.These days i rarely
      carry cash with me, unless it is for emergemcies.This is possible due to
      the availabilty of cashless transactions. Even the gaming experience has
      changed from staring at my monitor to a point where it feels as if i'm
      inside the game itself.Thanks to virtual reality. We can all agree that
      technolgy has immensly simplified our lives. However with all this hacks
      that seem magical, keeping them secure is a major concern and a huge blow
      if you become a victim of security breach. It is important that you secure
      systems and applcations that contain a great deal of your personal
      information,ensure your favourite devices are protected from viruses and
      malware. Keep your softwares update to date. Use the latest versions of
      your favourite apps and avoid using the ones you don't trust.But
      anyways,it's amaing if we try to imagine what our growing civilation will
      be 1000 years from now.Its highly obvious that with the current rate of
      technological advancements, we will have conquered and inhabitated
      neighbouring planets and galaxies, or what do you think...
